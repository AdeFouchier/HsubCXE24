# HsubCXE24
Data and code for the manuscript "An unusual CRISPR/Cas9 modification of an esterase affects pheromone-based reproductive isolation between two moth species" by  Elise Fruitet, Arthur de Fouchier, David G. Heckel and Astrid T. Groot.

CXE24 can be referenced in the code or Data as CXE21 as data unavailable at the time of analysis made us reconsider the naming of our gene of interest.

Scripts have been run in R through R studio. Some of those scripts call Vina which must be installed on your computer. The .cxs scripts are to ran through ChimeraX.
Also,  the file, exectuables and folder paths in the scripts (mostly the docking ones) or in the inputs files (for instance "Enzyme_vs_pherobase-param_generator.xlsx") should be changed to match paths one the computer used to run the scripts.
